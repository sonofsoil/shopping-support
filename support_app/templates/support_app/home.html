			    <h1>AI Agent Paradigm: Stacking experts to solve complex tasks</h1>
			    <p class="textPara">
                    We achieved significant progress in content classification, generation, summarization,
                    expansion and Q&A in the field of Generative AI. The emergent <b>Agent</b> pattern where
                    we assign a role to LLM and give it certain <b>Tools</b> to perform complex tasks via
                    multi-turn interaction makes Generative AI even more powerful. <b>Agent</b> paradigm makes
                    the LLM reason and act(ReACT) based on the assigned role and tools in its disposal; the
                    complex task is broken into smaller simpler tasks to achieve final outcome.
               </p>
               <p class="textPara">
                    The <b>Agent</b> pattern is inherently composable as well. With the right abstraction of
                    <b>Tool</b>, it is very much possible to wrap an <b>Agent</b> as a <b>Tool</b> and used
                    by another <b>Agent</b>, the <b>Expert Tool</b>. That ability gives rise to various level
                    of expertise and building higher-order <b>Agents</b> for more complex tasks. This is no
                    different from microservice paradigm, where we built high-order API composing lower-order
                    API.  
               </p>
                <p class="textPara">
                    This is a small demo of a <b>Agent</b> functionality, its composability and reusability.
                    We used OpenAI GPT-3.5-Turbo as our LLM and LangChang library for <b>Agent</b> implementation.
                    We also show how an organization can build various level or expertise via <b>Tool</b>
                    abstraction and associated registry.
